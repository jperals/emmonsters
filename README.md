# Emmonsters
Generative funny creatures dedicated to my niece Emma.

# How To
- To generate emmonsters, you just need [Processing](http://processing.org) with the [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/) library installed.

- Open `emmonsters.pde` on Processing and run the sketch to generate a new emmonster.

- Pressing `r` will generate a new one, and `s` will save a screenshot inside the `screenshots` directory.

- Feel free to hack the sketch yourself and have fun.
